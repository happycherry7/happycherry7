Hello, I am happycherry7, 
My favroite hobbies are gaming and drawing art, it is so much fun!
In the past I have learned Javascript, Python, HTML, and a bit of CCS.
I love the colours pink and purple because they are really pretty shades of colour.
My favroite animals are: Pandas becuase they look soooo cute, Foxes and Squrrels becuase they are daredevils, and Narwals, becuase they the unicorns of the sea!
My favroite subjects are Art and Sports becuase they are super fun, and my least faroite subjects are english, maths(though sometimes it can be fun), geography and science.
I live in england, cambridge and in witer most of the time, it is soooo freezeing!
My favroite season is summer becuase it is hot and it is brighter during the day.
Last but not least, my faroite element is nature  and wind beucase the wind is kinda fun to play in becuase the leaves are blowing everywhere and nature beucase it provides us everything!

Thanks for reading my profile and have a happy day!
